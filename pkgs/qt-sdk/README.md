# AUR recipe for consistent creation of Qt SDKS for various targets

What started out as the intention to facilitate Qt cross platform development for the Raspberry Pi has grown legs and now been extended to:

1) Raspberry Pi 0/1
2) Raspberry Pi 2
3) Raspberry Pi 3
4) Tinkerboard
5) Jetson-Nano

if you dont use Arch or consume this recipe, you can always extract information from PKGBUILD which is basically a bash script.
