#   This file is parsed when using System V initscript or openrc-initscript,
#   but it is ignored when using systemd to start up wwwoffle.
#   When using systemd, edit the wwwoffle service definition directly to change startup options.

# The following variables are understood (as of version 2.9j+svn2227-5):
