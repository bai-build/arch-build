# Originally, this script was used to copy the cache directories to .config/onelife
# However, the cache directories changed, and now would require copying most of the game
# data to .config/onelife. I (hopefully) temporarily changed the permissons on the 
# directories the cache files are stored in
# This script is mainly kept because it stores the settings in a user-writable area
