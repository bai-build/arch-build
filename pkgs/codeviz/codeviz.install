  Patched gcc is installed to /opt/gccgraph. To compile a project
  for use with CodeViz, it is necessary to use this version of
  gcc for compilation, such as:

    make CC=/opt/gccgraph/bin/gcc or g++

  To generate a full.graph file for C, use

    genfull

  For C++, make sure you use the cppdepn method with

    genfull -g cppdepn

  or the results will not be what you expect.
