Change Log for Aspic
--------------------

Version 1.05  04 March 2008
---------------------------

 1. Tidied Makefile so that it shows only a short line for each compiled file.
 
 2. Added the -testing feature to avoid the version identification in the PS 
    and SVG output, thus making it easier to maintain the tests.
    
 3. Text strings associated with non-horizontal lines are moved 3 points to
    the right by default - they were hitting vertical lines. Text strings 
    associated with arcs are moved 6 points to the right by default for the 
    same reason. 
    
 4. When computing the bounding box of a picture, a rough guess at the size of
    a string is now made, in order to take into account strings that stick out
    out of the sides of a picture. Previously, strings were ignored when
    computing boundinb boxes, leading to very bad values in some cases.
    However, since Aspic doesn't actually process strings, the new code is just
    a heuristic guess, though it seems to do a reasonable job.
    
 5. SVG output was not including strings associated with invisible lines. 
 
 6. Improve vertical positioning of multiple strings when fonts of sizes
    other than the default 12 points are used. The "textdepth" and "fontdepth"
    parameters are now minima. When multiple lines of text are printed, if the
    font size is greater than the textdepth setting, the larger size is used.
    Similarly, if half the font size is greater than the fontdepth setting, it
    is used. This is all heuristical, since Aspic doesn't really process text.
    
 7. Fix some uninitialized values bugs (found by valgrind).  
 
 8. Change string character handling to recognize UTF-8 characters and 
    encodings using the &...; mechanism.
    
 9. Add the -tr option to translate quotes and en-dashes. 
     

Version 1.04  20 January 2008
-----------------------------

 1. Fixed a bug that caused invisible boxes and ellipses not to be filled if
    a filling colour was defined. I think the fix for 1.01 below broke it.
      

Version 1.03  09 January 2008
-----------------------------

 1. Fixed a bug that caused the wrong colour to be used in PostScript output in
    certain cases for items following an arrow that was associated with
    coloured text.


Version 1.02  26 September 2007
-------------------------------

 1. Added the "include" facility.
 
 2. The "level" facility wasn't working properly for PostScript output. 
 
 3. Add the ability to colour text. 
  

Version 1.01  06 June 2007
--------------------------

 1. PostScript output was going wrong for invisible boxes and lines that had
    attached text strings.
      

Version 1.00  28 December 2004
------------------------------

 1. Added the "redraw" facility for use with SGCAL and sgpoint.
  

Version 0.09  15 December 2004
------------------------------

 1. Separated Aspic from the SGCAL command bundle and made it freestanding.
    Abolished the separate configuration file, and instead implemented three
    separate output modules for PostScript, SVG, and SGCAL output. Revised the 
    command interface.
