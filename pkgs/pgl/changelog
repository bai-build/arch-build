	list all dependencies, including those from the base group.
	
2015-01-25 Gilrain <gilrain+libre.arch A_T castelmo DOT_ re>
	* 2.3.0-1:
	new upstream release:	
    blocklists:
      - Removed atma_atma, discontinued upstream
      - Removed TBG blocklists, TBG's blocklists haven't been updated by
        iblocklist.com since 2014-10-20. But AFAIK TBG still maintains them, so
        search the web if you want to continue to use them.
      - New default set by Bluetack, probably less paranoid then in the
      past. Comments welcome:
        ads-trackers-and-bad-pr0n
        bad-peers

    removed the (non-default) feature to directly DROP and ACCEPT packets
      (as in MoBlock 0.8), instead of using the (default) MARKing feature.
      Dropped the configuration variables ACCEPT and REJECT.
      Reason:
      ACCEPTing/DROPing packets directly was only needed for kernel/netfilter
      not supporting MARKing. Probably it was also a bit more efficient than
      MARKing.
      But ACCEPTing packets directly breaks other iptables setups - this has
      always been documented, but wasn't known to all users. So in order to
      avoid misconfigurations I decided to drop this feature.
      DROPing directly should not yield any drawbacks, but I decided to also
      remove it in order to make the code simpler.
    documentation updates
    dropped backup code and checks for transitions (2010-08-11)
        REJECT_FW -> REJECT_FWD
        WHITE_TCP_FORWARD -> WHITE_TCP_FWD
        WHITE_UDP_FORWARD -> WHITE_UDP_FWD
        WHITE_IP_FORWARD -> WHITE_IP_FWD
    dropped code for transition 2011-05-28: remove old master blocklists
    improved the test for kernel REJECT support
    pglcmd status: add test for iptables
    pglcmd test_net: Create BLOCKLISTS_DIR if missing
      Closes: https://sourceforge.net/p/peerguardian/bugs/328/
    pglcmd: Set kernel queue maximum length with pglcmd variable
      NFQUEUE_MAXLEN to trigger pgld -Q option
    pglcmd build_blocklist: merge 2 grep commands
    systemd/cron: added systemd service for blocklists update by Pierre Buard
      (Gilrain). Closes: https://sourceforge.net/p/peerguardian/patches/3/
      This only gets installed if pgl is compiled with --with-systemd.
    Update nfq_set_verdict_mark calls to nfq_set_verdict2, requires
      libnetfilter-queue >= 1.0. A version without this commit is maintained
      in the git branch pgl_backport.
    Change declaration of "payload" to match what NFQ expects
    pgld: added option -Q to set kernel queue maximum length. See
      http://sourceforge.net/p/peerguardian/discussion/446997/thread/0df72ba6/
      Therefore increased kernel version requirement from >= 2.6.13 for NFQUEUE
      support to >= 2.6.20 (If you don't use the new option older kernel still
      work.)
