To use this program, please check /etc/gitd/gitd.conf and configure it using your preferred notification program. Also, you have to have a notification server running in order for the notifications to be caught, and many DE's support this natively. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications for more details on this. In order for the program to start, one has to let systemd know about gitd. Type
        systemctl enable gitd.service
        systemctl start gitd.service
to complete the installation. For more information, see gitd(8)
