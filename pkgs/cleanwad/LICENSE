The original permissions message was "You may use any part of this source
file provided you give me credit.", so the original work of Serge Smirnov is
hereby acknowledged - he put the hard work in when CleanWAD was first made.

Authors MAY use the contents of this file as a base for modification or reuse
provided that you e-mail the current author a copy and give them the right to
use parts of your work in future releases. [The same ought really to be done for
the original author of CleanWAD but he seems to have totally disappeared from
the DOOM community]. You must also credit work of all previous authors and that
of the original author, Serge Smirnov. Permissions have been obtained from
original author for any of their resources modified or included in this file
(he gave permission in the original source code provided he was credited).

You MAY (and are encouraged to) distribute and use CleanWAD, provided:

    (1) This entire collection of files is distributed UNMODIFIED,
	preferably in the original ZIP file in which it should have come. I
	have received permission from the original authors of any modified
	or included content in this file to allow further distribution.
    (2) The distribution is on a non-commercial basis; you may put CleanWAD
	on FTP sites or CD or other media as part of a collection for which
	you are charging a fee as long as you understand that the fee is for
	the collecting and (if applicable) the media, *not* for CleanWAD.
    (3) You accept that as with all free systems provided free of charge for
	like-minded people,CleanWAD is NOT guaranteed to work completely or
	correctly although it is likely to do so; thus it is a condition of
	use that you accept that as with most such products, you use it at
	your own risk. CleanWAD is **NOT** designed to be fault-tolerant!
    (4) Any legal disputes over CleanWAD or any part of it, including these
	terms and conditions, shall be governed by the Laws of England;
	furthermore, you do not have permission to use CleanWAD in any
	jurisdiction whose laws modify or limit these conditions unless you
	VOLUNTARILY accept these conditions as if under the Laws of England.

Note: although it won't happen straight away, once I have ensured that none of
Serge Smirnov's original code is left, I will CONSIDER releasing it under GPL.
