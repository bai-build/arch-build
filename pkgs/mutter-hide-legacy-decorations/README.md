# mutter-hide-legacy-decorations

Removes Title Bar of legacy (non-headerbar) application windows if they are maximized.

**Works best in combination with the [Status Title Bar Extension](https://github.com/emerinohdz/status-title-bar)**, which will show the window title in the top bar for maximized windows. That way the window title is visible even though the title bar is hidden. You can install it from [GNOME Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/59/status-title-bar/).
