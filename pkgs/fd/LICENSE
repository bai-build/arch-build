 <0. Preface> 

 This document is written for FDclone license. 

 FDclone is free software, using the income 
 The limit for a totally unaffected, including the request from the author's wishful thinking, this 
 Here are details about the individual and adapted to the case. 


 <1. Definition of Terms> 

 Let us first define terms used in this document. This document 
 , Unless otherwise noted, the following words are written here 
 We use a particular sense. 

 Source 
 Set of source programs. Or, documents and other 
 Containing a set of packages. 

 Binary 
 By running a set obtained by compiling the source program 
 Nari. Or, documents and other packages containing 
 Set of pages. 

 Distributed 
 In the broad sense, the replication of binary or source (question of whether a modification 
 No) and tend to give to third parties. In the narrow sense, it 
 That tend to give a few specific replication. 

 Distribution 
 Form of broad distribution. A replica of the source or binary, public 
 Widely distributed across the board to give the spot. 

 Distributed following a primary distribution 
 Distributed by his creator (or distribution). 

 Secondary distribution Secondary distribution 
 You distribute the primary distribution or primary distribution other than the author (or 
 The distribution). , Distributed as follows: three (or tertiary distribution), 
 Quartic distribution (distribution or fourth) and counting. 

 Redistribution distributed 
 After the secondary distribution (or distribution) collectively. 

 Modification 
 To tweak some of the original source or binary. 

 Secondary Use 
組込N use the software to another part of the original source 
 . 


 <2. For distributed> 

 The distribution is narrow, and whether the source binary modification 
 Can be freely distributed. Non-profit and for profit, regardless of the purpose and free line 
 What is it you. It is distributed for free as well and after three distributed. 

 However, the author is not responsible for what has been distributed at all. Kai 
 If you need the guarantee that it works correctly and does not change, re - 
 Please ensure that the distribution itself. 


 <3. Redistributed> 

 For distribution, both re頒whether the modified binary source 
 Cloth is possible. As with narrow distribution, free or構I business applications 
 Not. 

 However, part of the responsibility to take the author to be redistributed, 
 Some form of distribution of a registration system設KEMASU distribution. Registered been distributed 
 No redistribution of goods, as well as distributed, and the author has no responsibility or rambunctiousness 
 Not. 
 The distribution of the registered distribution, and equal responsibility of the primary distribution 
負IMASU these authors. If you do not need it registered a distribution is made 
 You can be. 

 The following three distributed after the registration for the distribution and redistribution once 
 Therefore, redistribution from the registration form and content of the package distribution 
 Only if the modification is not entirely the responsibility of the authors and equal redistribution of 
負IMASU. 
 If you made any modifications to the package, distributed at the registration 
 It is invalid, as the authors do not re-register the distribution of responsibility 
 FITNESS. 

 However, some of the secondary distribution of the registered secondary distribution distribution 
 If granted a conditional license, after the following three conditions are distributed and 
 Follow. 
 The distribution laid registration, licensing侵SANAI range of primary distribution 
 And at the, the second distribution can be set free after three terms of redistribution 
 So, if you examine the redistribution of the secondary distribution, distribution to the second question 
 Please match. 
 Have been registered as distribution, distributed after the third author 
 Itself will not interfere. 


 <4. The responsibility for the author> 

 The distribution of the re-registration and distribution of primary distribution, the authors are responsible 
 Partly responsible. 
 Specifically, according to inquiries and requests from users, if necessary 
 To do a revision of the program. The malicious functionality not specified 
 To ensure that it works correctly織込MAZU. 
 If you do not work as designed and written documentation, other

 The authors have a responsibility to address the request.

 <5. The source distribution register> 

 The distribution of the source, any change in the distribution package: 1 
 If not, even without a registered author responsible for distribution will be part of the responsibility 
 . 
 If there are changes to the package, break in the program source 
 No change, only to add or change a document or program 
 You are covered as well as the absence of any change. 
 In these cases, changing the package shape, ie, a compression method and package 
 Change the page names, etc. are ignored. 

 Part of the program source or binary to run the Makefile, etc. 
 If any modification to the files directly involved, the registration line source distribution 
 Responsible for part of the responsibility of the author redistributed by U. 
 Follow the steps below distribute registration, please register their distribution. 


 <6. Registration binary distribution> 

 The binary distribution is not about redistribution of the distribution is a registered 
 Off the author is not responsible. Without any change from a binary distribution: 
 This is true even if. 
 If you need the assurance of the author,拘RAZU or without modification, distribution, Noboru below 
 Follow the recorded instructions, please do register distribution. 

 A request from the authors, with the binary distribution, especially high-risk 
 It is recommended that registered distribute their available means. 


 <7. Modification Program> 

 If used to modify a portion of the program the user was a professional 
 And that if g is treated as a separate work, questioned where the amount of modification 
 First, second assumed. 
 The second modification is not considered and distributed in accordance with the above rules 
 If, on the secondary use is free of copyright as a work of secondary 
 Can be treated. 


 <8. The publication of a book> 

 Books on CD-ROM will be marketed through the media, etc. If you want to attach, re - 
 Assumed distribution. 
 If you need the assurance of the author, or BAINA Attached is the source of the 
 Depending on whether the list, please do the registration and distribution. Other 
 Are treated equally and no redistribution. 
 However, for the attachment of the redistribution that is already registered distribution, change 
 Distribution and needed to register it is not registered to distribute the distribution 
 Please follow the conditions. 

 Not attached, as if the only article about simply the liability and warranty

 <9. The registration distribution> 

 If you want to register distribute, perform this procedure by following steps: 
 System. 

 1. Establish a representative distribution. 
 2. Version.h distributor of NULL variables in place of the charge distribution 
    E-mail to the address書換ERU. 
    Example: 
    char * distributor = "shirai@unixusers.net (Takashi SHIRAI)"; 
 3. To create an incremental change from the primary distribution source package. Add Attachment 
    If the material is to be included in the differential with it. 
 4. To create a distribution package. 
 5. The distribution package before you check the MD5 checksum. Buy 
    Nari if the distribution is also executable FDclone own style 
    BERU. 
    If you do not look the way, FDclone to "checkid" built a 
    We have a good command to use it. The compiler FDclone 
    The LE, and start the "h" key command Pro EXECUTE_SH 
    In NPUTO "checkid <file name>" to run, MD5 Choi 
    KKUSAMU appears. 
 6. Made to the author, incremental change and distribute packages with MD5 checksums 
    Register or distribute the e-mail Send E-mail. If the binary distribution,頒
    Cloth environment to work in binary (OS, Platform, etc.) and executed by-Na 
    To add a list of MD5 checksums. 
 7. If you want to change the terms of redistribution, the language distributing registration 
    In explaining such. 

 In the face of a register, or see a clear binary distribution source distribution or register 
 So please. By registering and Na distribution in the source text at the same registration 
 You can register for the distribution list. 
 Requirements for registration of a binary distribution, the same incremental change 
 If the redistribution is done by enumerating the multiple operating environments, a 
 Registration can be distributed simultaneously to all registered operating environment distribution. 

 Note: If you are unfamiliar about the concrete work, before the registration 
 Please contact to the author.
