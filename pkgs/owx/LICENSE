Program is licensed under beer-ware license. We're HAMs and not lawyers,
so no law hell applies here (nobody really reads licenses anyways), just
pure HAM spirit. You are free to do with this program whatever you like,
just be nice and don't remove the original authorship - that would be a
bit shitty. If you feel that this code is worth this, you can just shout
us some beer or donate some doges to this DogeCoin address:

If you don't like the beer-ware license, like, if you prefer fruity
drinks or something, you can use the Apache 2.0 license instead.
