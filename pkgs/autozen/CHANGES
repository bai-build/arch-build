2.1
	Added ability to specify number of harmonics on command line. 

    Added HARMONICS command to AutoZen and seq2wav. 

    A VOLUME command at the beginning of a sequence is now processed before AutoZen
    	starts producing sound. 

	Autozen now looks in ~/.autozen and /usr/share/AutoZen for sequence files when
		the play button is presed. the ~/.autozen directory is created if it doesn't 
		exist.

	Added install to Makefile.

    The source tar has been fully debianized. 

2.0
	Added -colorbox option
		The colorbox is a simple window which oscillates between red and green
		in synch with the audio phase difference. Hopefully, the color change 
		will inject a second autozen signal into the visual cortex.

		When the colorbox is active, a phase adjustment slide is provided at the 
		bottom of the main Autozen window. A phase adjust is necessary since I don't 
		know the time delay difference between the auditory and visual signal paths 
		and it may, in fact, be different for each individual. The strongest 
		entrainment should be achieved by adjusting the phase control so that the 
		auditory and visual signals arrive simultainiously in the midbrain. Other 
		interesting effects may be achievable by detuning the phase from that setting 
		to create an interference pattern in the brain (thus stimulating only some areas). 
		Not much is known about that yet, so please keep logs of experiments in that area. 

	At user request, the max beat frequency is now 40 Hz. 

	Code cleanup (again). 
		Window creation has been moved into seperate functions to enhance readability.
		A few other small fixes made.
		A few more things are #defines now.

1.3
	Minor appearance and readability cleanups for GUI.

	Added sequencer commands for seq2wav to control volume fade
	when producing wav files.

	Added EXIT sequencer command to cause AutoZen to fade volume and
	quit rather than continuing at the final beat frequency when a
	sequence ends.

	Added time.pl, a simple script to total up how long a sequence file
	will play for.

	Should compile for Solaris and *BSD by uncommenting a line in Makefile
		Thanks to Trevor Johnson for this.

	Added a debian sub-directory to facilitate making a .deb.

1.2.1

	A small but important bug in the sound generation function. 
	When it's too early, (2^i) looks like it should do pow(2,i) :-) 

1.2

	Much improved effectiveness. It now uses several upper harmonics of 
	the tones with the same phase relation as the base frequency. 

	Fade in/out. Audio is now faded in when AutoZen is started, and 
	fades back out when Quit is pressed. Press Quit twice to exit instantly. 
	Play button graphic now changes based on state. Now displays vertical 
	bars when playing a sequence and a yellow triangle when a sequence is 
	paused. 

	More code cleanup. Factored sound generation into logical functions. 

	Generalized sound functions so that harmonics can be easily mixed in 
	with the base frequency. 

	Added seq2wav. 

1.1 
	Internal version, not released.

1.0 
	This is the initial public release.
