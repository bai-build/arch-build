# RCRaid DKMS

This package is based off version 9 of the linux rcraid driver.

## Dependencies

SDK can be downloaded [here](https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/amd-socket-strx4/trx40) under `Linux x86_64` -> `AMD RAID Driver - Ubuntu`.

Ubuntu 20.04.02 uses a new kernel than Red Hat, so it should require less patches.

## Utils

### probe_new_versions.sh

Can be used to probe for new versions of the driver.
