                      ReZound aims to be a stable, open source, and graphical audio file editor primarily for but not limited to the Linux operating system.
                      [this description needs revision now]

                                                                                             — W h a t ' s   N e x t —
                      Not particularly ordered:

                        • Preview for Effects (feature discussed [14]here)
                        • Better audio output code for full compliance with [15]JACK's realtime requirements
                        • A Configuration Dialog to Change All the Settings (stored in ~/.rezound/registry.dat right now)
                        • Equalizer action
                        • Some sorts of noise removal (contingent upon [16]gwc-lib'sdevelopment)
                        • Give option for using libsndfile and/or audiofile. (Waiting for libsndfile to finish implementing cues/markers and user notes support etc.)

                      These are the tentative main objectives to accomplish before calling it 1.0

                                                                                                    — N e w s —
