# Before first run you need to configure http server
# so that directory "/run/acme-challenge"
# was the alias of "/.well-known/acme-challenge"
#
# Nginx example:
#  location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
#    alias /run/acme-challenge;
#  }
#
# Manual run:
#    systemctl start acme@example
#
# Show status:
#    journalctl -e -u acme@example
#
# If no errors, then certificate and key will be placed in the directory /var/lib/acme/certs/example
#
# Enable daily timer check and renew certs:
#  systemctl enable --now acme@example.timer

# List domain names included in certificate separated by space. All domains should work and refer to this server.
