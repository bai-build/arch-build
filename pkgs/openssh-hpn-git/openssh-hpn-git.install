IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
This PKGBUILD does NOT (!!!) follow the upstream
OpenSSH-Portable distribution (at
https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable ) but rather a
fork which is maintained by rapier (primarily for Gentoo
Linux I believe). The fork includes the HPN patches and can be
found at https://github.com/rapier1/openssh-portable

Since I do NOT maintain this fork in any way, but merely
package it for Arch Linux, there is absolutely no warranty for
this code. It is very possible that the current version of the
fork still contains open security bugs which have already been
fixed in upstream OpenSSH.

USE THIS PKGBUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK AND ONLY IF YOU FULLY
UNDERSTAND THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF NOT USING THE MOST
RECENT OFFICIAL OPENSSH !

Consider yourself warned.

If security is paramount for you or in case of any doubt,
please use the official OpenSSH distribution instead.
