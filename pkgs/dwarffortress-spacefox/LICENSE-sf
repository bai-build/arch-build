Hey Spacefox here. 

Some people have contacted me about using the Dwarf sprites in their game, tileset or website. You have my permission to use these Sprites provided:

- You don't monetize my sprites. Eg, paid game (i made these for the dwarf fortress community to enjoy. They are free to share and use)
- I'm NOT the creator of Pheobus' Tileset or any of it's assets. If you want to use those assets, you will need to ask permission from the respective creators!
- Please make sure to credit me and of course Sphyr, the creator of the original dwarves on which my sprites are based upon.

Thankyou.
