Subject: glamor: Fix dashed line rendering.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We were binding the screen pixmap as the dash and sampling its alpha,
which is usually just 1.0 (no dashing at all).

Please cherry-pick this to active stable branches.
