# Example printcap file for network postscript printer The "bounce"
# syntax is needed to make lpd pay attention to the filter (see lprng
# documentation) when the printer is not connected directly to the
# server machine, e.g., via a usb port.  The user lpr command goes to
# the first squawk, which then relays it to the second one.  The
# filter "myfilter" is a print filter, perhaps customized from the
# examples "foofilter", "gsfilter" or "psfilter".  Options like
# specifying the number of copies (mc#...) must be placed in the
# bounce receiver entry as shown.
