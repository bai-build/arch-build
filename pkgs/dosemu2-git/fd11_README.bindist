====================================================
The DOSEMU/FreeDos ready-to-use binary distribution.
====================================================


INSTALL
-------

An easy way to get DOSEMU working on your machine is to use
the ready-to-use DOSEMU binary distribution. This one comes in 2 packages
from www.dosemu.org:

  - dosemu-freedos-<version>-bin.tgz

      A tarball containing a collection of suitable FreeDos binaries,
      eventually patched to fit DOSEMU needs, together with some GNU
      tools you may find useful.

  - dosemu-<version>-bin.tgz

      A tarball containing the recent DOSEMU binaries together with a
      user local configuration setup.

This installation fits into any user HOME directory and can be used
and installed without root permissions.
You have to unpack _both_ tarballs (as a normal user, NOT as root) into
the same directory (regardless what ever) within your HOME, such as:

  $ mkdir mydos
  $ cd mydos
  $ tar -zxf dosemu-freedos-bin.tgz
  $ tar -zxf dosemu-<version>-bin.tgz
  $ cd dosemu

now look where you are and what was installed:

  $ pwd
  /home/joeuser/mydos/dosemu
  $ ls
  README.bindist  bin             dosemu          xdosemu
  Xfonts          conf            freedos



RUN
---

After you get the install right, you can execute DOSEMU with

  $ cd ~mydos/dosemu             # (your CWD _must_ be here)
  $ ./xdosemu

which will use X or execute

  $ ./dosemu

which will just start within the current terminal or console.

If you have never used DOSEMU before, you will get prompted (once) that you
have read the liability disclaimer and after you agree, DOSEMU will boot
FreeDos and give you a command prompt.

If for some reason it does not start, look at boot.log for details.

Remember, that you can't use <Ctrl>-C _within_ DOS to exit _from_ DOS.
For this you need to execute 'exitemu' or, when using xdosemu,
<Ctrl><Alt><PgDn>.

Your Linux $HOME is available as DOS drive D:

For DOS applications which only read/write from/to STDIN/STDOUT,
you may prefer to invoke DOSEMU such as

  $ ./dosemu -dumb

this has the advantage that (A) the output of the DOS application stacks
up in your xterm scroll buffer and (B) you can redirect it to a file such as

  $ ./dosemu -dumb dir > listing

Note that DOSEMU command.com's commandline editor/history will also work
here, however, editing is restricted to BACKSPACE'ing.

-------

The sources of all the included binaries can be found in the
dosemu-freedos*sources.tgz tarball.
