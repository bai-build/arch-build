Subject: [PATCH] Fix config visibility violation in //testing/gmock
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

//third_party/googletest:gtest_config has restricted visibility, current
code works by accident because gn only enforces visibility on 'configs'.
Fix by not referencing the configs at all as it should be unnecessary:
//testing/gmock gets them via a public dependency chain anyway.

This is one of a few fixes needed to roll gn past the upcoming
enforcement change, landing in small parts because removing config
usages feels a bit subtle.

Bug: gn:252
