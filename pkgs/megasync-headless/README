Some notes about this package:

The package creates and install 3 executables:
*) megacli - advanced console MEGA client, to get information about available commands please start the 
application in the Terminal and type h to get commands description.
*) megasimplesync - a simple synchronization client, it gets username / password values from corresponding 
environment variables.
*) megafuse: to mount a remote mega directory

These executables are part of the MEGA SDK and are provided as examples
They are considered by MEGA experimental software and are not supported.

The package compiles only a subset of the original MEGA SDK, the mimimun necessary for these 3 files to work.

The package contains no code of mine, except for the PKGBUILD and the mega.service file.

Remember to edit the configuration file /etc/conf.d/megasync.conf
