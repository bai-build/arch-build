# This is the local configuration for whitelisted hostnames for sqlgrey.
#
# hostname.domain.com # whole system name (least CPU intensive)
# *.domain.com        # whitelist any fqdn in the domain 'domain.com'
# /regexp/            # whitelist any fqdn matching the regexp (by far most CPU intensive)

# Note you need the following two lines to allow both
# <lots of mtas>.example.com and example.com
# *.example.com
# example.com
