  echo Start both libvirtd.service and virtlogd.service. Optionally enable
  echo libvirtd.service. There is no need to enable virtlogd.service, since
  echo libvirtd.service, when enabled, also enables the virtlogd.socket and
  echo virtlockd.socket units. Then start/enable wokd.service and connect your
  echo browser to https://localhost:8001
