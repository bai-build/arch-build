MadGraph installer Arch Linux.

[MadGraph5_aMC@NLO][homepage] is a framework that aims at providing all the
elements necessary for SM and BSM phenomenology, such as the computations of
cross sections, the generation of hard events and their matching with event
generators, and the use of a variety of tools relevant to event manipulation and
analysis. Processes can be simulated to LO accuracy for any user-defined
Lagrangian, and the NLO accuracy in the case of QCD corrections to SM
processes. Matrix elements at the tree- and one-loop-level can also be obtained.

MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is the new version of both MadGraph5 and aMC@NLO that unifies
the LO and NLO lines of development of automated tools within the MadGraph
family. It therefore supersedes all the MadGraph5 1.5.x versions and all the
beta versions of aMC@NLO.

The standard reference for the use of the code is:

> order differential cross sections, and their matching to parton shower
> simulations", [doi:10.1007/JHEP07(2014)079][doi]
