------------------------------
Important Upgrade Information:
------------------------------
If the Air Video client app shows that certain media files are 'invalid', 
your thumbnail cache has been corrupted due to a dependency package 
version incompatibility.

The solution is to clear out the thumbnail cache. Run the following at
the command line:

rm -rv ~/.air-video-server

Note: You will need to login as 'root' and run the above command if the
server is started as a daemon.
