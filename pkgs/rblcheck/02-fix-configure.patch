-dnl Figure out where to get res_query from. First, see if it's in the
-dnl C library (Linux, and probably a few others). Then, check libbind
-dnl (generally, if you've installed bind 8, you're going to want to use
-dnl the new library). Finally, check for libresolv (which should exist
-dnl on most systems).
