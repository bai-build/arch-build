This package builds a kernel with a modified code to prevent the "Unknown PCI header type 127" which occurs among others on AMD Navi cards when working with vfio.
This experimental patch was developed by Geoffrey McRae (@gnif from Level1Techs) and has been successfully tested with the "RX 5700 XT" and the "RX 5700 Anniversary Edition".
 
When you build the kernel it will install itself as another kernel in your /boot/ directory (or whichever you choose to use) as "vmlinuz-linux-fix_navi_reset".
You will then have to change the entry in your bootloader to boot this kernel file. It will then boot the patched version which should make your AMD Navi card
work with vfio.

Should you have any more questions, you can contact the maintainer of this package.
