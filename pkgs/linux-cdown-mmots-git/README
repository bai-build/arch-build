This is based on the "linux" pkgbuild, which you can export with `asp export
linux`.

The only things changed are the source URL, the name, the config, and the
pkgver.

The config is based on stock -ARCH, but `make localmodconfig` is added to build
process (after `make olddefconfig`) to speed up compilation.

To speed up initial clone, you might want to do this in this directory so it
uses the local checkout to start. After that, hopefully yay should be able to
use the existing cache.

git clone --mirror ~/git/linux-mmots archlinux-linux
git -C archlinux-linux remote set-url origin https://github.com/cdown/linux-mmots

The "dogfooding" branch is master + any of my patches which are not yet in the
latest mmots tarball.
