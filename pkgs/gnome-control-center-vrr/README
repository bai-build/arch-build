Some info about how I create this patch file:
- I clone the mutter git repo
- I add the doraskayo mutter 42 repo as a remote
- I generate a diff between the latest tag and the remote branch for 42

See here for reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1968512/getting-the-difference-between-two-repositories


Example:
git pull
git remote update
git diff 42.4...remotes/doraskayo/vrr-support-42 > 42.4.patch
