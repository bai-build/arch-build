# AUR PKGBUILD

Here is hosted the PKGBUILD script for the current Metacall CLI.

The variable `METACALL_LOADER_language=on` can be set in order to build with support of a specific loader.

Supported loaders are found in the [following documentation](https://github.com/metacall/core/blob/develop/docs/README.md#21-loaders-backends).
