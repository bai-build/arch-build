[zram0]
# This section describes the settings for /dev/zram0.
#
# The maximum amount of memory (in MiB). If the machine has more RAM
# than this, zram device will not be created.
#
# The default is 2048 MiB, i.e. the device is only created on machines
# with limited memory.
#
# "host-memory-limit = none" may be used to disable this limit.
host-memory-limit = none

# The fraction of memory to use as ZRAM. For example, if the machine
# has 1 GiB, and zram-fraction=0.25, then the zram device will have
# 256 MiB. Values in the range 0.10â€“0.40 are recommended.
#
# The default is 0.25.
zram-fraction = 0.5

# The maximum size of the zram device (in MiB).
#
# If host-memory times zram-fraction is greater than this,
# the size will be capped to this amount;
# for example, on a machine with 2 GiB of RAM and with zram-fraction=0.5,
# the device would still be 512 MiB in size due to the limit below.
#
# The default is 4096.
max-zram-size = none

# The compression algorithm to use for the zram device,
# or leave unspecified for your distribution's default.
compression-algorithm = lzo-rle
