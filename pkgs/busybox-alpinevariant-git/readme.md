#### That  .config  work in progress
#### Main goals limit resource usage and make ash primary shell in desktop env.

#### Done (1.35-git) :
#### config cloned from alpine busybox 
#### no job control
#### no network utils
#### built mostly for ash shell 
#### awk & vi - disabled shell commands execution
#### use /usr/bin/* instead of built-in
