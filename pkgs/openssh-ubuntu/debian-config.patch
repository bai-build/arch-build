Subject: Various Debian-specific configuration changes

ssh: Enable ForwardX11Trusted, returning to earlier semantics which cause
fewer problems with existing setups (http://bugs.debian.org/237021).

ssh: Set 'SendEnv LANG LC_*' by default (http://bugs.debian.org/264024).

ssh: Enable HashKnownHosts by default to try to limit the spread of ssh
worms.

ssh: Enable GSSAPIAuthentication and disable GSSAPIDelegateCredentials by
default.

sshd: Refer to /usr/share/doc/openssh-server/README.Debian.gz alongside
PermitRootLogin default.

Document all of this, along with several sshd defaults set in
debian/openssh-server.postinst.
