## Installation

This can be installed from the AUR using your favorite AUR wrapper or manually
by cloning the repository and running the following commands.

```sh
# This will likely fail because some of our dependencies live only in the AUR.
# makepkg will tell you which it can't find. Install those from the AUR and
# this should work.
$ makepkg -si
```
