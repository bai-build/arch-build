This xastir-cvs PKGBUILD installs the most up-to-date (often called`bleeding edge' ) version of xastir from the CVS repositories on sourceforge.net.  Arch packaging standards require that the installation be placed in /usr/share/xastir, not /usr/local/share/xastir as stated in the xastir documentation.  There will also be a .xastir folder in the home directory.

Sound
======
To enable the speech feature, you must have the festival package installed (you will also need a speaker package such as festival-en or festival-english) before building xastir.   Festival must be running before xastir is started for speech to function properly.  I was able to start it on the command line with

$festival --server

or you can write a simple script to automate the sequential starting process.  There may be problems if other programs such as a media player are accessing sound simultaneously.  The PKGBUILD automatically downloads an 850 kB bundle of .wav files located at:

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/xastir/xastir-sounds.tgz

and places them here:

/usr/share/xastir/sounds/

These are audio alarm recordings of a North American English speaker dating from 2003.  The audio play command `play' in the configure menu may not work; try `aplay' instead. 

Patching xastir 2.0.0 for the ABS
===========================
As of October 2010, the most current `stable' release was xastir 2.0.0.  This was an important release because the developers migrated from defunct Tiger Maps to Open Street Maps (OSM).  xastir-2.0.0 can be built from source using the usual process of 

./configure
make
sudo make install

It is not, however, compatible with the Arch Build System (ABS) unless the makefile is patched.  A patch is needed to fix errors in the destination directories.  Tom Russo provided a patch to accomplish this:

-- Makefile.am	8 Sep 2010 18:13:26 -0000	1.57
+++ Makefile.am	9 Nov 2010 01:48:13 -0000	1.58

To use the patch, create an empty file (named fixdestdir.patch here), paste in the above text, and place it somewhere in your home directory.  The patch is called with a line that is added to a standard PKGBUILD at the top of the build command:

patch < $path-to-patch-file/fixdestdir.patch

Note that this patch is NOT necessary if xastir is built from CVS.  The developers fixed the problem in a subsequent CVS release.
