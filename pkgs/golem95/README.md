Golem95 installer Arch Linux.

[Golem95][homepage] is a package for the numerical evaluation of integrals and
tensor form factors entering the calculation of one-loop amplitudes with up to
six external legs, written in Fortran 95.

Golem95 performs the reduction to a certain set of basis integrals numerically,
using a formalism where inverse Gram determinants can be avoided.  The library
contains massless as well as massive integrals and also can handle complex
masses.  Infrared and ultraviolet divergences are regulated by dimensional
regularization. Integrals with tensor ranks exceeding the number of propagators
are supported.
