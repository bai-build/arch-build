  <summary>Two players, two castles, and a hill in between</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Two castles, separated by a mountain, try to defeat each other with their
      cannonballs, either by killing the opponent's king or by weakening the
      opponent enough so that the king capitulates.

      Ballerburg was originally written 1987 by Eckhard Kruse, for the Atari ST
      machines (which were brand new computers at that point in time). Over 25
      years later, here's finally the adaption of the original source code to
      modern operating systems.
